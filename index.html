                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

            <p> Ummmmm...... apparently the secret to time travel only takes a few hours to figure out when just earlier in the day it was impossible. What the hell is up with half hulk. So glad this was the last one, so many holes in the story that defies all logic that was just previously explained in this same movie, like thor's hammer getting removed from the original timeline and creating a whole universe where the same stuff is happening. Did captain america travel to that distant planet and put the soul stone backand reinject the other stone into thor's girlfriend and put back thors hammer. By the movies own logic they created multiple universes where they didnt win. Marvel changed to much as they went along, I could write a better story in the time it takes me to poop. However, I need someone to write good dialogue. Great movie if your 5 years old. So disappointing. I could go on all day, idk why so many people liked it. I liked the other marvels but this sucked. Captain marvel's hair cut lol... and more. </p>

                        Researchers analysing material found in a rock shelter in the Acacus mountains in south-west Libya say they have found more than 17,500 animal remains dating from between 10,200 and 4,650 years ago, 80% of which are fish. About two-thirds of the fish were catfish and the rest were tilapia. The team say telltale marks on the bones reveal the fish were eaten by humans who used the shelter.

                        It is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains.

                        “All the other finds are surface finds, [from] just one layer, one period, one event. Whereas what we have here is a 5,000-year sequence with a lot of bones – so that makes it special,” said Dr Wim van Neer from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, a co-author of the study.

                        The discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago.</P>
